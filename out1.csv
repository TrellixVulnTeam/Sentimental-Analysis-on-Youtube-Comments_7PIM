Who wrote this silliness? It sounds like a high school book report. Maybe high schoolers are the targeted audience!
May 29th was his birthday, darling.
After watching this, there are evidently at least three things that you all STILL don't know about John F. Kennedy. 

First, JFK was born on May 29, 1917, NOT May 19th as this video says on two occasions.

Second - Kennedy was NEVER the mayor of Boston,  or anywhere else. He was elected to the U.S. Congress from the 11th district of Massachusetts in 1946.

And lastly, JFK did indeed receive the last rites of the Catholic Church after he was shot, but before he was pronounced dead on November 22, 1963. Father Oscar Huber of the Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Dallas, Texas performed them on the dying president. As the video states, he previously received them several times during his life because of his terrible physical health.
He was born on May 29th, not May 19th
